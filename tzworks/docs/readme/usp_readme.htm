<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>usp</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>usp</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>usp</i></b> is a command line version of a tool that finds documented USB storage 
device artifacts on an NTFS system volume.  Sources of artifacts include the 
registry hives as well as some log files that Windows updates autonomously when
a usb device is inserted into a computer.  One of the issues <b><i>usp</i></b> solves 
is taking artifacts from different locations and matching like entries to connect 
scattered information into a quick look report.  The artifacts <b><i>usp</i></b> analyzes 
are documented in various publications. See references below.</p>

<p>In the reports that <b><i>usp</i></b> generates, we avoid putting statements like the
'last time usb device was inserted' and opted to put the last write time of 
selected registry keys.  From empirical testing, it was found, in certain cases, 
the last write time of a selected registry key did not necessarily correlate to the 
last insert time of a specific USB device.  While these were corner cases, we did not 
want to mislead any user in the outputs produced by this tool.</p>

<p><b><i>usp</i></b> was designed so that it could be compiled to run on any operating system 
to analyze Windows USB storage artifacts, but can also work on a live Windows 
system.  When analyzing a live system, <b><i>usp</i></b> is much slower than if it was coded to 
directly access the Windows registry API's. Making the engine Windows API 
agnostic causes <b><i>usp</i></b> to take snapshots of the registry hives and certain 
logs directly from raw clusters on the live volume to produce results.  One can 
see this difference when running <b><i>usp</i></b> on extracted copies of hive and log files
(ref usage example #3 below), where the extracted copies can be accessed directly.</p>

<p>When processing images of NTFS volumes in an off-line manner, <b><i>usp</i></b> expects 
to parse an image that is a 'bit-for-bit' copy of the original volume (eg. images 
obtained with a 'dd' or similar type tool).</p>

<p>This version of <b><i>usp</i></b> has been compiled to run on  Windows (XP, Vista or 
Win7), Linux and Mac OS-X.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Usage---------------------->
<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>


<p>Since <b><i>usp</i></b> is a command line tool, one will need to open the command
prompt.  Below is the menu with the various options.  Details of each option can be found 
<a href="#options">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
   usp - full ver: 0.26; Copyright (c) TZWorks LLC
   
   Usage
    (note: options with ** are enabled with a commercial license)
   
      usp -livesys                              = pull artifacts from live sys
      usp -sys &lt;syshive&gt; [-user &lt;userhive&gt;] [-setupapi &lt;file&gt;] [-sw &lt;swhive&gt;]
      usp -image &lt;file&gt; [-offset &lt;vol offset&gt;]  = ** use image as source
      usp -vmdk "file1 | file2 | .."            = ** process a VMWare VMDK vol
      usp -drivenum &lt;#&gt; [-offset &lt;vol offset&gt;]  = ** use drive num as source
      usp -partition &lt;drive letter&gt;             = ** use partition as source
   
    Basic Options
     -csv                            = output is comma separated value format
     -v                              = verbose, multiple lines per record
     -sys "system hive"              = use specified system hive
     -user "hive1 | hive2 | ..."     = add user hive(s) to analysis
     -setupapi "file1 | file2 | .."  = add setupapi file(s) to analysis
     -sw "software hive"             = ** add s/w hive to analysis
   
    Additional Options
     -dateformat yyyy/mm/dd          = ** "mm/dd/yyyy'" is the default
     -timeformat hh:mm:ss            = ** "hh:mm:ss.xxx" is the default
     -no_whitespace                  = ** remove whitespace between csv delimiter
     -csv_separator "|"              = ** change csv delimiter to a pipe char
</pre>
<h4>Running on live system requires running <b><i>usp</i></b> w/ administrative privileges</h4>
<div><pre>
        usp -livesys 
</pre>
<p>The default output is stats on each USB device on one line using a delimiter per entry.   
It is best to redirect the output to a file, since the lines are very 
long to display the information. Below is an example:</p>
<pre>
        usp -livesys &gt; results.txt
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Running on a partition image or drive image obtained w/ 'dd' or some other
tool that gives a bit for bit equivalent image.</h4>
<div>
<pre>
        usp -image &lt;disk image&gt; [-offset &lt;volume offset&gt;]
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Running on extracted copies of the registry hives and setupapi.[dev].log files</h4>
<div>
<p>After extracting the needed files: (a) the appropriate hives from <i>&#37;windir&#37;\sytem32\config\system</i> 
and <i>&#37;userprofile&#37;\ntuser.dat</i>, (b) the setupapi log(s) from <i>&#37;windir&#37;\setupapi.log</i> (xp) 
or <i>&#37;windir&#37;\inf\setupapi.dev.log</i> (vista and later), one can invoke
<b><i>usp</i></b> on the extracted files:</p>
<pre>
        usp -sys &lt;system hive&gt; [-user &lt;user hive&gt;] [-sw &lt;software hive&gt;] [-setupapi &lt;file1&gt;] [-csv]
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Experimental options:</h4>
<div>
    <p>The first set of experimental options are to analyze an external drive that has a 
    system partition on it.  First one requires one to know the physical drive 
    number and volume offset within the drive that has the system partition.  
    The second one, assumes one can mount the external drive as a drive letter.. 
    Both of these options assume the partition has a system partition.</p>

    <pre>
            usp -drivenum &lt;num&gt; [-offset &lt;volume offset&gt;]
            usp -partition &lt;drive letter&gt; 
    </pre>

    <p>For VMWare Virtual hard drives that only have 1 partition on it, one can use this
    experimental option.  This also assumes the VMWare drive is signatured as 'KDMV' 
    and is a monolithic type drive (eg. the drive is not broken into separate files).   
    </p>
    <pre>
            usp -vmdk &lt;VMDK disk file&gt;
    </pre>

        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this 
        option.</td>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
