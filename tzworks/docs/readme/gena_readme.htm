<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>gena</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>gena</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>The forensic community has been providing consistent feedback on the TZWorks 
toolset in identifying which tools and capabilities are important to them.   
This feedback is valuable and allows us at TZWorks to focus on areas useful 
to the community and is one of the reasons we continue to develop new tools. 
One item we hear repeatedly is a request to provide a GUI (Graphical User 
Interface) front end to some of the TZWorks command line tools.  While we 
internally prefer command line tools for automated processing, we do have a 
handful of GUI based tools that we develop for internal use only, primarily 
for reversing and analyzing new artifacts.   So we decided to take one of 
our internal tools, take out some of the more arcane options, and merge the 
backend processing with <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> and some other tools to come 
up with <b><i>gena</i></b>. </p> 

<p>The name <b><i>gena</i></b> is short for Graphical Engine for NTFS 
Analysis.  Along the way, we made some significant additions to 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>, as well, to allow <b><i>gena</i></b> to be used as 
a flexible tool for data extraction.  We also incorporated some capabilities 
from <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> <b><i>ntfsdir</i></b>, and <b><i>wisp</i></b> 
into <b><i>gena</i></b>. So while this document is a readme for 
<b><i>gena</i></b>, there are references to some of these other 
tools throughout.</p>

<p>When developing a GUI app we have stuck with the FOX (Free Objects 
for X) C++ toolkit, since it is cross platform, light weight, fast in 
performance and compiles into a static library that is relatively small 
when compared to the other GUI toolkits.  FOX, however, has some 
drawbacks in that it may not have the look and feel that a normal 
Windows application may have.  The GUI front end for <b><i>gena</i></b> 
uses the FOX toolkit.</p>

<p>Similar to the other TZWorks tools that were mentioned, <b><i>gena</i></b> 
is designed to work with live (mounted) NTFS volumes.  There is also 
functionality for traversing either NTFS images (a) created with the dd 
utility or (b) from a monolithic volume consisting of VMWare VMDK files.  
Whether <b><i>gena</i></b> is being used for live incident response 
collection or to process an image in an off-line manner, there are options 
to filter on file extensions, a timestamp range, various binary signatures, 
partial filenames and directory contents. For targeted files found, one can 
list the summary metadata, extract the header bytes of the file data, 
or extract the entire file contents into a designated directory.  
Since the GUI front end and backend parsing engine are both Windows 
API agnostic, there are compiled versions for Windows, Linux and 
Mac OS X.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Usage---------------------->
<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>
<div>
<p>The <b><i>gena</i></b> GUI is divided into two main window panes.  The first 
pane is on the left, and is a quasi-Windows Explorer view of the volume under 
analysis.  The right pane is governed by a series of tabs that reflect differing 
functionality.  The number of tabs is dependent on the MFT record (or inode) 
that is selected on the left tree-view pane.   This is the area where one 
can invoke the <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> tool or peer into the details of an
 MFT record.   The first and default tab is for the <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> 
 dialog.  It exposes various options unique to <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>.</p>

<p>When one loads a volume for analysis, a series of additional tabs 
automatically become visible.  This includes: a tab for MFT record metadata 
(timestamp, cluster runs, etc.), a tab for the hexadecimal dump of the file 
record under analysis, and a separate tab for each NTFS attribute containing 
data.  The term data defined here, can include: (a) the unnamed data stream, 
(b) any alternate named data streams, (c) the directory's INDX data, 
(d) a Logged Stream data, and (e) various others.   To keep things simple, 
each unique data set is selectable with a separate data tab.</p>

<p>Currently there are four types of source data <b><i>gena</i></b> can 
analyze, including: (a) NTFS drive/volume stored as a ‘dd’ type image, 
(b) NTFS mounted drive/volume, (c) an exported $MFT file, or (d) a 
VMWare volume.  To analyze an image or mounted volume, one uses the 'File' 
menu to selected the desired data source.</p>

<h4>Format Options</h4>
<p>There are a few data format options, grouped by the following 
categories: (a) Final output, (b) Date Format, and (c) Time Resolution. </p>

<p>The first category, final output, tells <b><i>gena</i></b> how to format 
the results file <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> produces.  This can either be: 
(a) default output, (b) CSV format, (c) Log2Timeline format, (d) BodyFile 
format or (e) a Hashfile.</p>

<p>The default option uses one line to specify the attributes per inode 
and uses the pipe character '|' as a separator.  The CSV option is similar 
to the default option, but forces all output to be in comma separated value 
format.  Thus, any data that had comma in its name are changed to space 
character to protect the integrity for the CSV fields.</p>

<p>The Log2Timeline option forces all output to be in CSV format and tries 
to conform to the log2timeline format specified by the website 
http://log2timeline.net/.  This output needs to be independently 
verified for correctness.  </p>

<p>The Bodyfile option outputs the data fields in accordance with the 
body-file version3 specified in the Sleuthkit.   The date and timestamp 
outputted to the body-file are in terms of UTC.   So if using the 
body-file in conjunction with the mactime.pl utility, one needs to 
set the environment variable TZ=UTC.  This output also needs to be 
independently verified for correctness.</p>

<p>The last option is the Hashfile format.  This option will generate 
both a MD5 and SHA1 entry as well as other metadata per inode that 
was processed.</p>

<p>Note:  If extracting data (eg. files) during the run, the first two 
options are the only options available.  If not extracting file content 
data, then all five options are available. </p>

<h4>Date/Time Format</h4>
<p>The date format can be selected based on desired convention.  The Date 
Format menu offers three common format options:  mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy 
or yyyy/mm/dd.   The default is set to the USA convention of: mm/dd/yyyy.</p>

<p>The time format has three resolution options:  (a) seconds, 
(b) milliseconds and (c) microseconds.  The default is set to milliseconds. </p> 
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> dialog tab---------------------->
<h2><a name="ntfswalk_tab"><b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> Dialog Tab</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>gena</i></b> was originally designed to be a front end to the 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> command line tool.  The additional capabilities added to 
version 0.45 of <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> coupled with <b><i>gena</i></b> make it easy 
to target specific files in a scripted manner, whether for incident response or normal 
forensic data collection.  <b><i>gena</i></b> puts many (but not all) of the available 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> command line options at easy access to the user and graphically 
arranges them by functionality.   Therefore, this is the tab to use, if you want to 
extract many files or analyze an entire volume.</p>

<p>If using <b><i>gena</i></b> just to setup a script for <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> to 
run later on another target box, one can use <b><i>gena</i></b> to select the desired 
options without loading an image, and select the 'Generate Script' button.  This 
action will package all the options selected, generate a script that is 
compatible to be invoked directly by <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> (in a command line mode).  
To handle this script, a new <i>-script</i> command line option has been added to 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>.  See the <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> documentation for more details. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if one wants to perform a data collection or volume analysis 
on a live system (or off-line image), one can point <b><i>gena</i></b> at any NTFS 
volume (or image) and it will operate on that target.   Selecting the 'Spawn <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>' 
button will do just that: spawn an instance of <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> as a separate 
process passing to it the options the user has selected.  <b><i>gena</i></b> and 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> really do not care whether the target volume is a live 
mounted image or a ‘dd’ image.  They process them the same way.  As an aside, 
since <b><i>gena</i></b> will spawn <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>, both tools should be in the 
same directory along with their authenticating licenses for this mode to work.  Using 
this latter technique, <b><i>gena</i></b> can spawn as many instances of 
<b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> that is desired while they run in parallel, assuming the host 
machine can handle the processing and memory load.</p>

<p>Since there is this close relationship between <b><i>gena</i></b> and <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>, 
only version 0.45 of <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> and later work with <b><i>gena</i></b>.</p>

<h4>Filter options w/ <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b></h4>

<p>The filtering options are where one can hone exactly what type of files they are 
interested in.   This turns out to be the primary way to speed up any target 
collection.  To understand the filter options, some background on <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>
 is useful.  Version 0.45 of <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> has been enhanced in a number of 
 ways from the prior versions.  While still evolving, filtering is one of the bigger 
 enhancements and was geared to help out in incident response collection.</p>

<p>The filtering architecture has been beefed up to allow for more combinations 
of options, some of which use OR logic and others which use AND logic.  Consequently, 
as the number of command line options increased, the complexity (and confusion 
factor) increased as well.  Fortunately, the <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> dialog tab in 
<b><i>gena</i></b> keeps the OR and the AND logic straight between the various options 
by the various grouping of options. </p>

<p>One can filter on any number of extensions, partial names, directories, and 
signatures.  This means they will all use OR logic, which translates to, if any 
of the inode's passes any one filter mentioned above it will go to the next step.  
The AND logic comes into play when looking at (a) filtering by date range and 
(b) filtering on deleted files.  Once an inode passes the filtering tests, it 
then proceeds to be outputted to the results file, and if, instructed, copied 
to the specified directory. </p>

<h4>Filtering on NTFS File Record data (external data)</h4>

<p>The most basic (and fastest) filtering one can perform is by filtering on 
the NTFS file record (or external) metadata.  This includes things as: (a) file
name, (b) file extension, (c) time stamp, (d) parent directory, (e) or 
inode.  The other mode of filtering is on internal, file content data.  This 
mode of filtering is discussed in the next section.  </p>

<h4>Filter on file content data (internal data)</h4>

<p>The more thorough (and slower) filtering one can perform is by filtering on 
the file content data.  The <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> engine will use predeterministic 
signature analysis to determine whether a file meets one of the available 
categories.  Only a few common ones were added to <b><i>gena</i></b>.  These 
include: (a) LNK files, (b) Event logs, (c) Registry hives, (d) SQLite3 
databases, and (e) executable and library files.  </p>

<h4>Selecting what clusters to scan and whether we are just interested in 
deleted records</h4>

<p>This category of options is broken up into four use-cases.  The first 
set is whether one just wishes to scan (a) all records in the $MFT data or 
(b) just the deleted records in the $MFT data.  The second set is whether 
one wants to scan (c) all the clusters of a volume or (d) just the 
deleted clusters of a volume.  A fast option is to only scan the $MFT 
data (eg. data in inode 0), while the more complete option is to scan 
'All clusters/All records'.   The default option is the former (all 
records in the $MFT data section).</p>

<h4>Selecting Files in a Time Range</h4>

<p>One can select a date range.  If at least one date (of the 4 MACB standard
information dates) for an inode is within this range, it will pass the test 
and be processed. Note all dates need to be expressed in UTC format and the 
date string needs to conform to: mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Results file options</h4>

<p>Each run will produce a results file.   In addition to the normal data 
that is provided, other data can be inserted as well.  In addition to 
changing the default hexadecimal output to base10 discussed previously, 
one can record the volume offset of the file record as well as record the 
cluster run.  </p>

<h4>Extraction Options</h4>

<p>If desiring to extract files to an archive directory, one can select the 
'Copy Target Files' checkbox.  If one is worried about copying malicious data 
from a target box one can change the extension of the file extracted by 
appending a *.bin to the file, so it is not accidently run should the file 
contain some malicious executable content.  To do this select the 'Append
.bin as extension' checkbox.</p>

<p> Other options include copying the file as 'raw' which means copy the file 
as the cluster data is represented and don't translate the data (this applies to the files that 
use the native NTFS compression).  Also the 'raw' option will copy all allocated 
clusters associated with the file and not just the 'used' clusters.  Therefore 
the 'raw' option will yield the slack that is available.   The last option 
is whether one wishes to include any sparse clusters as part of the file copy.  
The sparse clusters while present on some files, are not backed by physical 
clusters and therefore <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> will copy zeros in place of these 
sparse clusters, if this option is selected.</p>

<p>The extraction directory for both the results file and any files extracted 
is specified by the text entry box "Results Directory".  The default directory is 
'GENA_Results' under the current working directory.  Whatever directory is inputted 
here will be used as the parent directory for archiving data.  <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b>
will create subdirectories under this parent directory to categorizes different 
runs as well as categorize data within a run.</p>

<h4>Extracted Files Naming convention</h4>

<p>If you selected files to be extracted, then for each file extracted, the file name 
will consist of 3 items: (a) first the timestamp of the last modify time, 
(b) the computed MD5 hash of the file and (c) the original filename. </p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------MFT Record Metadata Tab---------------------->
<h2><a name="mft_record_tab">MFT Record Metadata Tab</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>The metadata in this tab includes an 'interpreted' version of the NTFS file 
record.  What this means, is if <b><i>gena</i></b> sees a standard information 
attribute, it shows the properties and timestamps associated with this sort of 
NTFS attribute.  Likewise, if <b><i>gena</i></b> sees a filename attribute, it 
shows the name, parent inode and timestamps associated with this attribute.  
For data attributes, <b><i>gena</i></b> shows the size data (allocated vice file 
size) as well as any cluster runs that house the data.  For other attributes 
where parsing is not done, but data is available, <b><i>gena</i></b> will show 
these attributes in a separate tab.  </p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Volume Tab---------------------->
<h2><a name="volume_tab">Volume Tab</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tab shows a hexadecimal view of the volume under analysis.  When synced 
with the selected inode from the directory tree, it will display the raw file 
record data</p>

<p>With this tab, one has the freedom to look at any volume offset that is 
desired.  To do this, just select the 'Manually inputted' radio button and 
the offset field will be activated as well as the display button. One has 
the option of traversing the volume either by volume offset address or by 
volume logical cluster number.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------<b><i>wisp</i></b> Tab---------------------->
<h2><a name="wisp_tab"><b><i>wisp</i></b> Tab</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>When selecting any directory from the tree view, a <b><i>wisp</i></b> 
(Windows INDX Slack Parser) tab is displayed.  Since <b><i>gena</i></b> can 
parse the INDX attribute to find the children to a directory, we incorporated 
a lite version of the TZWorks <b><i>wisp</i></b> engine.  This will allow 
<b><i>gena</i></b> not only to parse normal children but also slack entries 
(or children that have been deleted).   This is very useful in identifying 
deleted files after they have been wiped from the NTFS volume, since the file 
artifact could still be in the parent directory's INDX attribute. </p>

<p>Each entry will have a name, file size, and a set of timestamps.  For 
additional verification, we added the ability for each entry to show the 
source data (or hex dump of the data that was parsed), complete with actual 
offset of where the data resides in the INDX cluster run.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Data Tabs---------------------->
<h2><a name="data_tab">Data Tabs</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>gena</i></b> is very useful for displaying file data.  Not only does it show the 
normal data (unnamed data stream) and the alternate (named) data stream, 
but it also shows the Bitmap data, Logged Stream data, and various types 
of INDX data.  A good example is looking at the $Secure inode (#9).  
It has a number of attributes that contain data.  Without going into 
too much detail, it contains: (a) an $SDS alternate data stream, 
(b) $SII index root and allocation attributes, (c) $SII bitmap 
attribute, (d) $SDH index root and allocation attributes, and 
(d) an $SDH bitmap attribute.</p>

<p> While some of the attributes might only have a little bit of data or 
the data may reside as resident data within the file record itself, <b><i>gena</i></b> 
will display a separate tab for each data category. </p>

<p>Within each of these data tabs, are options to go to a specific offset, 
find a string or pattern or export the data to a separate file to analyze 
with another forensics tool.  In some cases it may be useful to represent 
the data as ASCII or Unicode instead of hexadecimal, so those options are 
there as well.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Scanning Mounted Drives---------------------->
<h2><a name="scan_drives">Scanning Mounted Drives</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>
<div>
<p>The Utilities menu was meant to be a catch-all location for helpful utilities.   
In this case, there was only one we had time to add to this and it includes the 
option to scan the mounted drives on a live system.  </p>

<p>When run, it will enumerate all the drives on a system and return a dialog 
box with the showing the drive, drive#, drive size, disk signature, partition 
information (offset, size and type), etc.  This is helpful when using 
<b><i>gena</i></b> to analyze a drive or image of a drive with multiple 
partitions and one wishes to find the volume offset.</p>
</div>

    
<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
