<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>jp</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>jp</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>jp</i></b> is a command line tool that targets NTFS change log journals.  
The change journal is a component of NTFS that will, when enabled, record changes 
made to files. The change journal is located in the <i>$UsnJrnl</i> MFT entry, and 
the journal entries are located in the alternate data stream <i>$J</i>. Each entry 
is of variable size and its internal structure is documented in the MSDN.</p>

<p>The change journal will record amongst other things: (a) time of the change, 
(b) affected file/directory, (c) change type - delete, rename, size extend, etc,
and therefore makes a useful tool when looking at a computer forensically.</p>

<p>Microsoft provides tools to look/affect the change journal as well as a published
API to programmatically read/write from/to the change log.  <b><i>jp</i></b> however, 
doesn't make use of the Windows API, but does the parsing by traversing the raw 
structures.  This allows <b><i>jp</i></b> to be compiled for use on other operating 
systems to parse the change journal as a component in a forensic toolkit. </p>

<p>Currently there are compiled versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS-X.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Change Log Journal Format Internals---------------------->
<h2><a name="internals">Change Log Journal Format Internals</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>The change log Journal data is located at the <i>[root]\$Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J</i> 
alternate data stream.   If present, examining the cluster run for the <i>$J</i> 
data stream will show the beginning clusters are sparse, meaning they are not 
backed by physical disk clusters and any data is after these sparse clusters.</p>

<p>The data within the journal is a series of packed entries.  The structure for
each entry is defined in the Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK).  This 
structure is shown below as documented by the SDK:
<pre>
    typedef struct {

        DWORD           RecordLength;
        WORD            MajorVersion;
        WORD            MinorVersion;
        DWORDLONG       FileReferenceNumber;
        DWORDLONG       ParentFileReferenceNumber;
        USN             Usn;
        LARGE_INTEGER   TimeStamp;
        DWORD           Reason;
        DWORD           SourceInfo;
        DWORD           SecurityId;
        DWORD           FileAttributes;
        WORD            FileNameLength;
        WORD            FileNameOffset;
        WCHAR           FileName[1];

    } USN_RECORD, *PUSN_RECORD;
</pre></p>

<p>While <b><i>jp</i></b> extracts all the data from each record, it outputs 
the following fields: (a) FileReferenceNumber (also referred to as MFT entry 
or inode for the file or directory), (b) ParentFileReferenceNumber (which is 
the parent inode), (c) Usn number (which translates to the offset within the 
data stream),  (d) TimeStamp (UTC date/time when the record was entered), 
(e) Reason (what change occurred to the file/dir that caused a journal 
entry), (f) FileAttributes and (g) Filename.  One also has the option 
to have <b><i>jp</i></b> resolve the parent inode to the directory path.</p>

<p>There are three data source options: (a) input from an extracted journal 
file, (b) a dd image of a volume or disk, and (c) a mounted partition of a 
live Windows machine.   <b><i>jp</i></b> can handle each equally well.</p>

<p><b><i>jp</i></b> can reconstruct the path of the journal entry
via either an exported <i>$MFT</i> file or using the internal <i>$MFT</i> of the 
specified volume (see options <font color="red"><i>-show_dir_path</i></font>
and <font color="red"><i>-mftfile </i></font>, in the options
section).  This is useful in easily identifying where the
target file was from. In version 1.08, <b><i>jp</i></b> will check
to ensure that both the inode and sequence number match the $MFT entry 
prior to reconstruction of the path.  If for some reason it cannot, it
will report in the output that the inode was reused in the $MFT.</p>

<p>Added with version 1.08, is that ability to extract MACB timestamps 
from the <i>$MFT</i> file, and in some cases, from deleted files.  To extract 
time information from deleted files, <b><i>jp</i></b> needs to analyze a 
volume where both the change log journal file and <i>$MFT</i> file are resident.  It then
can analyze the appropriate parent directory's slack INDX entries and see if any 
correspond to the journal entry. (see option <font color="red"><i>-pulltimes</i></font> 
from the options section).</p>

<p>There are four output format options available, ranging from: 
(a) the default CSV output, (b) XML format, (c) Log2Timeline format 
and (d) Body-file format from the Sleuth Kit.  The default and XML 
options yield the most data per record.  The Log2Timeline is geared 
for timeline analysis.  </p>

<p>For verbosity, the default option is the most useful.  It shows all 
the records that have been 'closed'.  If desiring to see 'all' the records, 
one can use the <font color="red"><i>-a</i></font> switch.    Using the 
<font color="red"><i>-a</i></font> switch gives one a lot of redundant 
data (eg it will show the action before the 'closed' action as well as 
the 'closed' action). The actions that occurred before the 'closed' action'
are also shown in the final 'closed' record. </p>

        restrictions with this option is a the colon (:) symbol needs to separate hours, minutes 
        and seconds, a period (.) symbol needs to separate the seconds and fractional seconds, and the 
        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this 
        option.</td>

    <li><b><i>jp</i></b> will attempt to sort the output chronologically, from oldest

    still generate one file with the output, however, will output the 
    data in 'chunks' where each chunk is sorted.  This is the default mode
    for the 32 bit version and is due to the amount of memory the 32 bit version
    is limited to.  The 64 bit version will attempt to keep all the parsed
    entries in memory and output a final sorted file.</li>

<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>

<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>
<div>
<ul type="square">
	<li>01/16/2014 - v1.08 - added new options -mftfile and -pulltimes (see options
							above).  ensured path reconstruction is accurate in the
							sense that both the inode and sequence number need to 
							match journal entry before path is reconstructed. added
							ability to pull slack INDX records to record timestamps
							on deleted files in journal.</li>
    <li>11/18/2013 - v1.07 - tweaked authentication options for demo license</li>
    <li>10/26/2013 - v1.06 - updated internal NTFS libraries</li>
	<li>10/09/2013 - v1.05 - modified the CSV output. updated the internal NTFS libraries</li>
    <li>08/22/2013 - v1.04 - routine library maintenance updates</li>
    <li>07/05/2013 - v1.03 - Added a number of new options: -dateformat, -timeformat
                            -no_whitespace, -csv_separator, -show_dir_path. Many of these
                            new options require a commercial license.   </li>
    <li>11/03/2012 - v1.02 - maintenance update of core libraries w/ bug fixes </li>
    <li>10/30/2012 v1.01 - fixed bug w/ NTFS inadvertently added in previous version</li>
    <li>09/24/2012 v1.00 - (a) added option to include parent path to entries.
    (b) added hash check to ensure binary integrity</li>
    <li>05/08/2012 v0.99 - fixed formatting bugs in the various outputs</li>
    <li>04/05/2012 v0.98 - added license authentication. </li>
    <li>03/17/2012 v0.97 - maintenance updates</li>
    <li>08/21/2011 v0.96 - added option to allow output to be base10 vice hex</li>
    <li>08/03/2011 v0.95 - added option to minimize memory usage</li>
    <li>07/31/2011 v0.94 - bug fixes - handles boundary condition of where the the usnjrnl
        is not sparse. also added logic to handle very large files.</li>
    <li>06/01/2011 v0.93 - added 32 and 64 bit versions to the mix. also fixed some boundary
        conditions where the live extraction of the change log journal failed. created an
        '-image' option that took over the functionality of '-partition_image'.</li>
    <li>05/20/2011 v0.92 - NTFS maintenance updates</li>
    <li>04/16/2011 v0.91 - added capability to parse disk images instead of just partition
        images.</li>
    <li>02/26/2011 v0.9 - maintenance update</li>
    <li>11/22/2010 v0.8 - maintenance update</li>
    <li>08/10/2010 v0.7 - ported over to MAC OS-X 10.6</li>
    <li>03/26/2010 v0.6 - fixed some minor bugs.</li>
    <li>03/21/2010 v0.5c - added -a [all records] option. Normally one is only interested
        in those operations/changes to the records that were closed. The -a option includes
        all records that were generated.</li>
    <li>03/14/2010 v0.5b - trying to parse past corrupted records</li>
    <li>03/06/2010 v0.5a - ported code so it could be compiled in Linux</li>
