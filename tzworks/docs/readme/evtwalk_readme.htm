<hr/><!---------------------About the 'evtwalk' Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <i>evtwalk</i> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>evtwalk</i></b> is a command line tool that can parse Windows event logs from all 
versions of Windows starting with Windows XP.  This includes Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 
and the server counterparts. </p>

<p>The output is presented with one event record per line and includes a couple of 
formatting options. Under the hood, <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> uses the same 
eventlog parsing engine as 
<a href="http://tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=4"><i>evtx_view</i></font></a>.
As a command line tool, <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> can easily be incorporated into any analysts' 
processing work-flow, by automating the execution of <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> via 
any scripting language.</p>

<p><b><i>evtwalk</i></b> allows one to generate reports of specific event log artifacts, 
such as USB plug-n-play events, user credential changes, password changes, 
logon/logoff events, etc.  If one of the 
available report options does not address an analyst's needs, there is an option for 
the user to generate his/her own custom report to be used and processed.  </p>


<p>There are 32 and 64 bit versions of <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> spanning Windows, Linux and 
Mac OS-X.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------How to use evtwalk---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use <i>evtwalk</i></a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<h4>Event Log Locations/Names (background)</h4>

<p>Windows event logs reside in different locations depending on whether one is on a 
Windows XP box, or later version, such as Windows 7 or 8.  In addition to the location differences, there 
are also (a) naming differences in the event log file itself, and (b) significantly
more event logs present starting with Vista and the later operating systems.  For example, 
Windows 7 can have over 70 unique event logs vice the three present in Windows XP.  
Below are the locations for the event logs with the various Windows operating 
systems.</p>

<p>Windows XP and earlier:</p>
<pre>
    %windir%\system32\config\[AppEvent.Evt | SecEvent.Evt | SysEvent.Evt]
</pre>

<p>Windows Vista and later (Windows 7, Windows 8, ...):</p>
<pre>
    %windir%\system32\winevt\logs\[Application.evtx | Security.evtx | System.evtx | ...]
</pre>


<h4>Starting <i>evtwalk</i></h4>

<p>While the  <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> tool doesn't require one to run with administrator 
privileges, without doing so may restrict one to only looking at separately extracted 
event logs, depending on the version of Windows and how the permissions are setup.
Therefore, it is recommended to run <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> with admin privileges, 
if desiring to look at the event logs on a live host machine.</p>

<p>One can display the menu options by typing in the executable's name with no 
parameters.  Below is the menu with the various options.  Details of each option can be found 
<a href="#options">here</a>.</p>
<pre>
   evtwalk - full ver: 0.16; Copyright (c) TZWorks LLC
   
   Usage:
    (note: options with ** are enabled with a commercial license):
   
     evtwalk -livesys [options]  = pull data from the running operating system
     evtwalk -log "eventlog1 | eventlog2 | ..." [options]
     dir c:\somedir\*.evtx /b /s | evtwalk -pipe [options]
   
    Report options
     -pw                    = ** pull password changes [security log]
     -time                  = ** pull clock changes or updates [security logs]
     -logon                 = ** pull logons [security log]

     -usb                   = ** pull usb events [system, DriverFrameworks logs]
     -cmdfile &lt;filename&gt;    = ** custom report defined by cmd file
   
    Processing options
     -pipe                  = ** pipe files into evtwalk for processing
     -quiet                 = ** don't display status during run
   
    Filter options
     -eventid "id1, id2, ." = **
     -string &lt;substring&gt;    = **
     -start_time &lt;time UTC&gt; = **
     -stop_time &lt;time UTC&gt;  = **
   
    Basic options
     -csv                   = output in comma separated value format
     -csvl2t                = log2timeline output  [needs validation]
     -bodyfile [-allparams] = sleuthkit output  [needs validation]
   
    Additional options
     -dateformat yyyy/mm/dd = ** "mm/dd/yyyy" is the default
     -timeformat hh:mm:ss   = ** "hh:mm:ss.xxx" is the default
     -no_whitespace         = ** remove whitespace between csv delimiter
     -csv_separator "|"     = ** use a pipe char for csv separator
</pre>

<p>  Of specific note, is there are some options that
are only available with a commercial license.  These are designated with a double
asterisk. The basic options, however, are available for personal/non-commercial
use.</p>

<p>For basic usage and to parse an individual event log file, use the following 
notation:</p>
<pre>
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -log &lt;event log file&gt;  &gt;  results.txt
</pre>


<p>Without specifying one of the format options, the output is rendered with a 
custom CSV format that uses the pipe character &quot;|&quot; as a delimiter vice a comma.  
All similar event IDs will be grouped together.  This allows  each grouping to have 
their specific unique headers (if applicable), since different events have different 
metadata.</p>

<p>In the command used above, the output is redirected to a text file called 
<i>results.txt</i>.  Like all artifacts that have many records and where each 
record has multiple fields, the output that is generated is usually very long and 
wide.  Thus, it is recommended that one redirect the output of the command to a 
file.</p>

<p>While parsing one event log file is useful, one will usually want to parse 
multiple event logs in one session.  There are three ways to do this: 
(a) specifying individual event logs via multiple  
<font color="red"><i>-log</i></font> options, 
(b) using the <font color="red"><i>-livesys</i></font> option or
(c) using the <font color="red"><i>-pipe</i></font> option.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------Specifying Multiple Individual Event Logs---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto_multiple">Specifying Multiple Individual Event Logs</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<p>To use the <font color="red"><i>-log &lt;event log 
file&gt;</i></font> option to specify multiple event logs, use the pipe
delimiter between each event log name, as shown below.</p>
<pre>
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b>  <font color="red">-log</font> "&lt;event log1&gt;|&lt;event log2&gt;|..." &gt;  results.txt
</pre>

<p>This is useful when pulling a similar category of artifacts from 
multiple event logs.  A good example of this is pulling USB events.  The two 
logs needed for USB plug-n-play events are the <i>System</i> 
event log and <i>DriverFrameworks-UserMode</i> event log.  If one 
extracts these two logs, one can invoke the following, rather lengthy, 
command to process all USB events from the two logs:</p>
<pre>
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -usb <font color="red">-log</font> "system.evtx | Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode%4Operational.evtx" &gt; results.txt
</pre>


<p>The <i>results.txt</i> file will contain a sorted set of groups of all &quot;like USB&quot; 
event IDs and will provide appropriate header fields that match the record metadata 
for each class of event.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------Examining all the Event Logs on the Currently Running Machine---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto_live">Examining all the Event Logs on the Currently Running Machine</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<p>For a live system, one can use the <font color="red"><i>-livesys</i></font> 
switch to examine all the event logs on a host machine.  In this mode, 
<b><i>evtwalk</i></b> will determine the Windows version of the host machine, 
and then will scan the appropriate event log directory for that version of 
Windows.  Below are some examples:</p>
<pre>
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -livesys  &gt;  results.txt
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -livesys -string &quot;tzworks&quot;  &gt;  results.txt
</pre>

<p>The first example will traverse all event log files found in the 
Windows event log directory and parse each record for each event log 
encountered.  The second example adds the <font color="red"><i>-string</i></font>
filter option.  It will also examine all the same event logs in the 
first example, but will only output records that contain the string 
&quot;<i>tzworks</i>&quot; in the one of the record fields.  More information about
the various filter options are discussed below.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------Examining Multiple Event Logs in a Directory or Subdirectories---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto_pipe">Examining Multiple Event Logs in a Directory or Subdirectories</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<p>If looking at a collection of event logs that are not part of the 
running operating system, but gathered as part of an investigation, 
one can invoke the <font color="red"><i>-pipe</i></font>  switch to
analyze all desired event logs in one session.   
The <font color="red"><i>-pipe</i></font> switch tells <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> 
to receive a separate path/filename per line as input and process each entry
separately.  By redirecting the output of the processed records to a file, one can generate
a single report for all the event logs piped in.</p>

<p>Depending on whether one is running on Windows or Linux during the piping
operation, the syntax is different.  For Windows, one can use the  
built-in <i>dir</i> command along with some of its companion switches to get the 
desired result. For Linux or Mac, one can use either the built-in <i>ls</i> or 
<i>find</i> command to get the desired result.  For the <i>ls</i> command, the switch
to use is -1 (the number one, vice the letter l).   Whatever option is used, one must
ensure the output of the command before the pipe character is: (a) is on its own 
line and (b) contains only the absolute path with filename.
Below is an example of using this option:</p>
<pre>
    dir c:\testcases\*.evtx /b /s | <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -pipe &gt; results.txt
    ls -1 ~/testcases/*.evtx | ./<b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -pipe &gt results.txt
</pre>

<p>The above syntax will process all the event log files with the extension 
<i>.evtx</i> that are located anywhere in the <i>c:\testcases</i> directory.</p>

<p>One can modify the output by inserting a report option and/or modify the output
by specifying another format to output.  Below is an example of processing the 
logons/logoffs for security event logs in the <i>c:\testcases</i> directory and subdirectories, 
outputting the results in a log2timeline report:</p>
<pre>
    dir c:\testcases\*.evtx /b /s | <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -pipe -logon -csvl2t > results.txt
    ls -1 ~/testcases/*.evtx | <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -pipe -logon -csvl2t > results.txt
</pre>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Generating Event Category Reports---------------------->
<h2><a name="canned">Generating Event Category Reports</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>


<div>
<p>Instead of outputting all the records that are present in an event log, one may only be 
interested in a certain class of event data. Depending on how the host machine 
was configured, for event records to be present, one may need to enable the event logging 
for a class of events.  Below are the report categories currently available for 
this tool:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
    <tr bgcolor="yellow">
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Extra</th>
        <th>Description</th>

		well as which fields within an event record to output. The syntax is 
		<font color="red"><i><b>-cmdfile &lt;filename&gt;</b></i></font>.</td>
    </tr>

</table>


<p>One can also have multiple report options.  Below is an example of pulling
the logon/logoff events as well as the USB events as a session.</p>
<pre>
    <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> -livesys -logon -usb &gt; results.txt
</pre>

<p>If there are other reports' an analyst wants to use that are not in the above list, or 
if one wishes to make modifications to the reports above, one can define one's own report 
via the <font color="red"><i>-cmdfile &lt;path\file&gt;</i></font> switch.  
The argument passed in is a text file that identifies which events to pull and 
which fields in the event record to output.   These 'cmdfiles' are called 
'User Defined Templates'.  More information about the format and rules to generate 
one of these files can be located <a href="#user_template">here</a>.</p>

        digit years, via the <font color="red"><i><b>"mm/dd/yy"</b></i></font>. The 
        restriction with this option is the forward slash (/) symbol needs to separate

        <font color="red"><i><b>"hh:mm:ss.xxxxxx"</b></i></font> or nanoseconds, 
        via <font color="red"><i><b>"hh:mm:ss.xxxxxxxxx"</b></i></font>, or no fractional seconds, via 
        <font color="red"><i><b>"hh:mm:ss"</b></i></font>. The 
        restrictions with this option is a the colon (:) symbol needs to separate hours, minutes 
        and seconds, a period (.) symbol needs to separate the seconds and fractional seconds, and the 
        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this 
        option.</td>

<hr/><!---------------------User Defined Templates---------------------->
<h2><a name="user_template">User Defined Templates (eg. cmdfiles)</a><br />
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>For those cases, where one would like to extract a certain group of event 
ID's, templates can be useful.  Once a template is defined, it can be used to 
ensure repeatable parsing of the same event ID's for each session run.  </p>

<p>The templates are just text files, so they can be generated with any text 
editor.  Care must be taken to ensure that extra control characters are not 
inserted into the text files.  Having extra control characters will negatively
affect the template parsing engine.  For this reason, it is recommended that 
a simple text editor be used.  </p>

<p>The parsing rules for these templates are as follows:</p>

<h4>General Rules</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Each line is parsed separately.</li>
    <li>A line that starts w/ a double forward slash (eg //) is ignored and used for comments</li>
    <li>A blank line is ignored.</li>
    <li>Any line not satisfying Rule 2 & 3 above is assumed to be a command.</li>
    <li>All command lines are in CSV format, where the separator is a comma.</li>
</ol>
 
 <h4>Command lines</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Must start with the sequence:   <b><i>!cmd</i></b></li>
    <li>and contain the following options, using comma delimiters (in any order):
    <pre>
    -enum_evtxlog   or  -enum_evtlog  depending on whether targeting a Win7 box or WinXP box
    -id, &lt;event id to extract&gt;
    -name, &lt;event name to use for output&gt;
    -conditions, &lt;parameter name|value name&gt;        .. note: the '|' pipe character separating the name and value
    -pull, &lt;parameter data to extract&gt;
    -type, [system | security | application | etc]
    </pre></li>
</ol>


<h4>Template Examples:</h4>
<pre>
    !cmd, -enum_evtxlog, -type, security, -id, 4624, -name, logon, -pull, TargetUserSid, -pull, SubjectUserSid, -pull, TargetUserName, -pull, LogonProcessName
    !cmd, -enum_evtxlog, -type, system, -id, 1074, -name, reboot or shutdown, -conditions, Data|winlogon.exe

    // for pre-vista (eg. xp) use the following:
    //
    !cmd, -enum_evtlog, -type, system, -id, 528, -name, reboot or shutdown, -conditions, Data|winlogon.exe
</pre>

<h4>Caution about using Templates</h4>
<p>When using templates to parse event logs, one needs to be careful to use the 
appropriate template for type of log file. One cannot blindly use a template for 
uncommon types of log files, unless you are aware each event ID in your template
is unique to that event log.   For example, if targeting the event ID# 4625,
for the security log, this would translate to a logon/failed event.  However, if
looking at the application log, event ID# 4625 is the suppression of duplicate log
entries.  To help avoid this issue, the -type, [system, security, application] 
option guides <b><i>evtwalk</i></b> to match the proper log file with the event 
ID specified.</p>

<p>The built in 'category' reports, however, have the necessary logic to avoid the above
issue.  Therefore, they can be safely thrown at many disparate log files (that may
contain duplicate event ID numbers with differing meanings) and the results should be 
accurate. </p>

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
