<hr/><!---------------------About the <i>cafae</i> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <i>cafae</i> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>cafae</i></b>, which is short for <b><font color="red">C</font></b>omputer 
<b><font color="red">A</font></b>ccount <b><font color="red">F</font></b>orensic 
<b><font color="red">A</font></b>rtifact <b><font color="red">E</font></b>xtractor, 
is a Windows registry parser that targets a few 
specific registry keys that help identify user activity as it pertains to files 
and program execution. Chosen are a handful of registry entries that are specific 
to an account's registry hive(s).  This includes both a user's ntuser.dat hive 
and the usrclass.dat hive for Vista and later. Collectively, these two registry 
hives contain artifacts useful in piecing together some sort of file/program 
activity that occurred on a specific account.</p>

<p>Why build another Windows registry parser when there are plenty of good 
registry parsers freely available on the Internet?  The answer is simple. We 
listened to the feedback that was submitted to our shop by the forensics 
community, specifically to take some of the 
<a href="https://www.tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=3"><i>yaru</i></a> 
functionality <sup>[1]</sup> 
and make an easy to use command line tool. The desire was to use be able to use it in a 
batch processing mode while outputting the data into one of the more common 
formats so that it could be 'somewhat easily' fused together with varying 
artifacts from other sources.  Prior to v0.17, we focused on ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat
hives.  Starting with v0.17, we extended report generation to include software, system 
and security hives. </p>
 
<p><b><i>cafae</i></b> consists of the same parsing engine that is in 
<a href="https://www.tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=3"><i>yaru</i></a> but 
packaged into a console application.  Consequently, the reports that are generated will 
look similar to those of <i>yaru's</i>, but will have more output options, such as a
couple of CSV variants, the ability to change the date format, ability to set the
time precision up to the native Windows internal precision (100 ns), and others. </p>


<p>Other useful aspects of <b><i>cafae</i></b> include the following:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Can parse hives from a live system (same as 
        <a href="https://www.tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=3"><i>yaru</i></a>).</li>
        <li>Is ubiquitous across WinXP through Win8 (meaning it figures what 
        version of the hive it is working on and then automatically adjusts 
        which registry keys should be used). </li>
        <li>In some cases, it can parse deeper into the metadata and pull 
        out additional artifacts than current registry parsers available.</li>
        <li>Non-Windows versions are available for those that choose to 
        process Windows artifacts on a non-Windows operating system.</li>
        <li>The architecture is extremely extensible to include additional 
        registry subkeys. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased.

<hr/><!---------------------How to use cafae---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use <i>cafae</i></a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>cafae</i></b> is a console application that primarily targets user registry 
hives (eg. ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat files), with some limited capability for other 
hives.  To use this tool on a live system, one will need to open 
the command prompt with administrator privileges first.  One can display the menu 
options by typing in the executable name with no parameters.  
The menu groups the available artifacts by area of analysis, 
where each artifact can be extracted independently or combined per command issued.    
Since each artifact comes from a specific type of user hive, each option identifies 
which hive (either ntuser.dat or usrclass.dat) it expects to receive as input for it 
to successfully extract data.</p>

<p>The registry artifacts are grouped into the following categories:  (a) running 
a program, (b) opening files, (c) searching/browsing and (d) network/computer 
settings.  The output options include: (a) the default output, where each record is on a 
separate line and each field is separated by the pipe character, (b) the SleuthKit 
body-file format and (c) the log2timeline CSV (comma separated value) format. </p>

<p>Below is the menu with the various options.  Details of each option can be found 
<a href="#options">here</a>.</p>

      -csv_separator "|"     = ** use a pipe char for csv separator
      -pipe                  = ** pipe hives into cafae for processing
</pre>

<p>To process a specified hive, one uses the <i>-hive &lt;location of hive to process&gt;</i> 
option with the specific artifact one is interested in.  For example, assuming a user 
hive was extracted to the c:\dump directory, one could to review all the Microsoft 
Office documents accessed by this user by typing:</p>
    <pre>
        <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive c:\dump\ntuser.dat -office_docs &gt; office_docs.txt
    </pre>
            
<p>Since the output that is generated is very wide, it is recommended that one redirect 
the output of the command into a file as show above.  Then it can be reviewed in any 
text editor by turning off the word wrap option to see each record on one line.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------Example Artifacts that are Extracted and Parsed---------------------->
<h2><a name="regkeys">Example Artifacts that are Extracted and Parsed</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>As a disclaimer, this version of <b><i>cafae</i></b> does not contain all the requisite registry 
keys that may be of interest to a computer forensic analyst, but it encompasses some 
of the more common ones.  Furthermore, every attempt has been made to ensure that 
this tool parses data correctly; however, parsers are only as good as the sample 
datasets that were used during the development/testing process. Since we have a limited 
set of sample hives to test on, we cannot guarantee that the data in your registry 
hives will be parsed accurately.</p>

<p>Below are examples of the more interesting registry artifacts <b><i>cafae</i></b> can extract.  
Each subsection includes which registry keys are examined and the command line syntax 
that is used</p>

<h4>Open -&gt; Run Dialog</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\LastVisitedMRU</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\LastVisitedPidlMRU</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\LastVisitedPidlMRULegacy</li>
</ul>
<p>These keys track the program that was last used to access files listed in the 
Open/Save dialog box MRU subkey. With Vista and later, most of these entries 
record the timestamp that the program was executed. The MRU (Most Recently Used) 
value will show the order of the entries, from the most recently used.   <b><i>cafae</i></b> 
makes use of this MRU value to sort the output from most to least recently accessed.</p>

<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -openrun_mru &gt; out.txt
</pre>


<h4>UserAssist Key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist </li>
</ul>
<p>This key contains values that identify programs executed by a user account. Entries 
are a mix of executable files and an associated link entry. Many of the entries contain the last 
execution time along with the number of times the application was run. While the last 
execution time seems reliable, the run count data is still under evaluation and is based 
on empirical data. Therefore the results of this output should be considered experimental.</p>

<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -userassist &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>ProgramsCache Key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage\ProgramsCache</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage2\ProgramsCache</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage2\ProgramsCacheTBP</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage2\ProgramsCacheSMP</li>
</ul>

<p>The ProgramsCache key records which application was launched as well as when it was 
launched.  The size of the file refers to the link file and not the target file 
the link points to.  Included are any parameters used with the link file.</p>

<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> cafae -hive user.winxp.hive -programs_cache &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>MUICache Key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\MUICache </li>
    <li>usrclass.dat\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache </li>
</ul>
<p>The operating system records what applications are launched by a user account, by 
recording the name of the application as well as the "File Description" information that 
is part of the version information stored in the portable executable of the binary that 
was launched. Unfortunately, there is no temporal information associated with each entry. </p>
    <pre>
        Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.winxp.hive -muicache &gt; out.txt
    </pre>

<h4>Run Key and Miscellaneous Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run </li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\?*\</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Sysinternals\?*\EulaAccepted</li>
</ul>

<p>The Run and RunOnce registry keys cause programs to run each time that a user logs on. The
SysInternals keys identifies which tool was run from the SysInternals suite.</p>

<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -otherapps_run &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>Recent Documents and Associated Keys</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs </li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\?*\Recent [File List]</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Adobe\?*\?*\AVGeneral\cRecentFiles\?*\tDIText</li>
    <li>and others ...</li>
</ul>
<p>For the standard ‘Explorer\RecentDocs’ item, this key contains the recent 
documents as identified in the Windows "My Recent Documents" menu. Within the key 
is a "MRUListEx" value that identifies the most recently viewed items. If one 
parses the MRUListEx, one can display the items in the order that they were 
accessed relative to each other.  <b><i>cafae</i></b> will output this list of items in the 
proper order starting with the most recently viewed first.  While there is no 
temporal information associated with each entry, one can use registry last 
modification time associated with the subkey to determine when the most recent 
item was opened.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -recent_docs &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>StreamMRU Key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StreamMRU</li>
</ul>

<p>Per the MSDN article 235994, the Streams registry entries store the size and 
location information for closed windows.  Per the article, Windows saves this 
information for up to 28 different windows. The association for the Streams subkey 
with a particular window is stored in the StreamMRU subkey.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.winxp.hive -stream_mru &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>Open -&gt; Save Dialog</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\OpenSaveMRU/?*/</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\OpenSavePidlMRU/?*/</li>
</ul>
<p>The operating system tracks files that have been opened or saved from an 
"Open/Save As" shell dialog box through this registry key. It contains values 
and a number of multiple subkeys. The subkeys group values by extension. With 
Vista and later, most of these entries record the timestamp that the action 
occurred.  <b><i>cafae</i></b> sorts these entries by folder subkey and then by most recently 
used.  The output includes an arrow to designate which item was the last one modified.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -opensave_mru &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>Keys Associated with Office Documents</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Office\?*\?*\Recent Files </li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Office\Office\?*\?*\File MRU</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Office\Office\?*\?*\Place MRU</li>
    <li>and others ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Per the MSDN article 826208, many Microsoft Office programs maintain a list 
of the most recently used (MRU) files.  Additionally, the various Office programs display this 
MRU list on the File menu and in several other locations. These locations include 
the Open dialog box, the Save As dialog box, and the Insert Hyperlink dialog 
box. The purpose of this feature is to provide quick access to files that a 
user is working on.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -office_docs &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>OpenWithList Key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\?*\OpenWithList</li>
</ul>
<p>This registry key has a separate subkey for each extension of a file that was 
opened.  Within each extension subkey, the list associates which application 
is used to open a file with that specific extension. </p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -open_with &gt; out.txt
</pre>


<h4>Search History</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Search Assistant\ACMru</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\WordWheelQuery</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows XP there is the ACMru key, which stores search terms that have been 
typed into a Windows search dialog box. The following subkeys define where 
the search term was used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5001 - List of terms used for the Internet Search Assistant </li>
    <li>5603 - List of terms used for the Windows XP files and folders search</li>
    <li>5604 - List of terms used in the "word or phrase in a file" search </li>
    <li>5647 - List of terms used in the "for computers or people" search </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, Vista did not include a registry key for user searches. Windows 7, 
however, defines the WordWheelQuery subkey to record information about user 
searches.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -search_history &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>TypedURLs key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs</li>
</ul>
<p>Data in this key is added when a user types a (or adds via a copy/paste) URL 
directly into the browser.  The list of URLs is sorted by number where the lowest 
number is the last (or most recently typed) URL.</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -typed_urls &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>Favorites key</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage\Favorites</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage2\Favorites</li>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Taskband\Favorites</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of keys covers the shortcuts on the Windows Start Menu and the 
TaskBar, respectively.  Show below is an example of the parsed output of the 
TaskBar shortcuts.  The some of the data is truncated to the right of the output.  
The additional fields include a cmdline parameter (for the icon), if needed, and 
any reference data (target executable for the link).</p>
<pre>
    Example: <b><i>cafae</i></b> -hive user.win7.hive -favorites &gt; out.txt
</pre>

<h4>Miscellaneous Metadata</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ntuser.dat\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2</li>

        restrictions with this option is a the colon (:) symbol needs to separate hours, minutes 
        and seconds, a period (.) symbol needs to separate the seconds and fractional seconds, and the 
        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this 
        option.</td>

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
